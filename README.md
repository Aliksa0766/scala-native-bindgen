# Scala Native Binding generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kornilova-l/scala-native-bindgen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/kornilova-l/scala-native-bindgen)

This tool generates Scala Native bindings from C headers. It's built upon clang and Libtooling and thus respects the conventions of clang-tools.

## Usage

Calling the tool is pretty easy, you need to specify the file(s) and the name of the created bindings.

`./scala-native-bindgen /usr/include/uv.h -name uv --`

Running the previous command wild also yield warnings along with the translation. To keep only the bindings please redirect the output to a file like this:

`./scala-native-bindgen /usr/include/uv.h -name uv -- > uv.scala`

Run `./scala-native-bindgen -help` to see all available options.

## Obtaining bindgen

There are 2 ways to obtain bindgen:
 * [use docker container](#docker-container) 
 * [build binary from sources](#building)

### Docker container

This option requires [Docker].

Download docker image with the binary:

```sh
docker pull scalabindgen/scala-native-bindgen
```

Mount directories with required header files and run bindgen:

```sh
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/src -v /usr/include:/usr/include \
  --rm scalabindgen/scala-native-bindgen \
  relative/path/to/my_header.h --name my_header --
```

The docker image does not contain standard headers so it is important to
mount all system include directories that are used by the header file
passed to `scala-native-bindgen`. See the [docker-bindgen.sh] script for
how to wrap the dockerized program. The `$CWD` of the container is
`/src` which should be mounted from `$(pwd)` in case relative paths are
used.

### Building

Building this tool requires [CMake], [LLVM] and [Clang]. See the [Scala
Native setup guide] for instructions on installing the dependencies.

```sh
mkdir -p bindgen/target
cd bindgen/target
cmake ..
make
./scala-native-bindgen /usr/include/ctype.h -name ctype --
```

Alternatively, you can use [docker-compose] to build and test the program:

```sh
# Build the docker image with LLVM version 6.0.
docker-compose build ubuntu-18.04-llvm-6.0
# Build the bindgen tool and run the tests.
docker-compose run --rm ubuntu-18.04-llvm-6.0
# Run the bindgen tool inside the container.
docker-compose run --rm ubuntu-18.04-llvm-6.0 bindgen/target/scala-native-bindgen -name union tests/samples/Union.h --
```

## Testing

The tests assume that the above instructions for building has been
followed.

```sh
cd tests
sbt test
```

## Current limitations
There are multiple unsupported cases that should be considered when generating bindings:
1. Currently bindgen does not support passing structs by value.  
    For example, it will not be possible to call these two functions from Scala Native code:
    ```c
    struct MyStruct {
        int a;
    };
    
    struct MyStruct returnStruct();
    
    void handleStruct(struct MyStruct mystr);
    ```
    To support such cases one should generate bindings for C wrapper functions that use pointers to structs instead of actual structs.
2. Bindgen does not generate bindings for defines.  
    In order to use defines one should write wrapper functions that return defined values.
3. There is no way to reuse already generated bindings.  
    Bindgen outputs bindings also for headers that were included in a given header.
4. Type qualifiers `const`, `volatile` and `restrict` are not supported.
