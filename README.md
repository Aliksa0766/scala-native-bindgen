# Scala Native Binding generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kornilova-l/scala-native-bindgen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/kornilova-l/scala-native-bindgen)

This tool generates Scala Native bindings from C headers. It's built upon clang and Libtooling and thus respects the conventions of clang-tools.

## Usage

Calling the tool is pretty easy, you need to specify the file(s) and the name of the created bindings.

```sh
scala-native-bindgen --name uv /usr/include/uv.h --
```

Running the previous command wild also yield warnings along with the translation. To keep only the bindings please redirect the output to a file like this:

```sh
scala-native-bindgen --name uv /usr/include/uv.h -- > uv.scala
```

Run `scala-native-bindgen --help` to see all available options.

## Obtaining bindgen

There are 2 ways to obtain bindgen:
 * [use docker container](#docker-container) 
 * [build binary from sources](#building)

### Docker container

This option requires [Docker].

Download docker image with the binary:

```sh
docker pull scalabindgen/scala-native-bindgen
```

Mount directories with required header files and run bindgen:

```sh
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/src -v /usr/include:/usr/include \
  --rm scalabindgen/scala-native-bindgen \
  relative/path/to/my_header.h --name my_header --
```

The docker image does not contain standard headers so it is important to
mount all system include directories that are used by the header file
passed to `scala-native-bindgen`. See the [docker-bindgen.sh] script for
how to wrap the dockerized program. The `$CWD` of the container is
`/src` which should be mounted from `$(pwd)` in case relative paths are
used.

Note, the `scalabindgen/scala-native-bindgen:latest` image is updated on
each merge to the `master` branch.

## Building

Building `scala-native-bindgen` requires the following tools and libraries:

 - [CMake] version 3.9 or higher
 - [LLVM] and [Clang] version 5.0 or 6.0.

```sh
# On apt-based systems
apt install cmake clang-$LLVM_VERSION libclang-$LLVM_VERSION-dev llvm-$LLVM_VERSION-dev

# With `brew`
brew install cmake llvm@6
```

To run the tests you also need the required Scala Native libraries.
See the [Scala Native setup guide] for instructions on installing the dependencies.

```sh
mkdir -p bindgen/target
cd bindgen/target
cmake ..
make
./scala-native-bindgen --name ctype /usr/include/ctype.h --
```

To build a statically linked executable pass `-DSTATIC_LINKING=ON` when invoking `cmake`:

```sh
cmake -DSTATIC_LINKING=ON ..
```

### Building with `docker-compose`

Alternatively, you can use [docker-compose] to build and test the program:

```sh
# Build the docker image with LLVM version 6.0.
docker-compose build ubuntu-18.04-llvm-6.0
# Build the bindgen tool and run the tests.
docker-compose run --rm ubuntu-18.04-llvm-6.0 ./script/test.sh
# Run the bindgen tool inside the container.
docker-compose run --rm ubuntu-18.04-llvm-6.0 \
    bindgen/target/scala-native-bindgen --name union tests/samples/Union.h --
```

## Testing

The tests assume that the above instructions for building `scala-native-bindgen` from source
has been followed.

```sh
cd tests
sbt test
```

## Limitations

There are multiple unsupported cases that should be considered when generating bindings:

 1. Currently bindgen does not support passing structs by value.  
    For example, it will not be possible to call these two functions from Scala Native code:
    ```c
    struct MyStruct {
        int a;
    };
    
    struct MyStruct returnStruct();
    
    void handleStruct(struct MyStruct mystr);
    ```
    To support such cases one should generate bindings for C wrapper functions that use pointers to structs instead of actual structs.
 2. `#define`s for literals and variables are supported. For other types of `#define`s,
    write wrapper functions that return defined values.
    ```c
    // Supported
    #define ESC 0x1b            /* Defines for numerical and string literals. */
    extern const int pi_const;
    #define PI pi_const         /* Defines aliasing extern variables. */

    // Not supported (non-exhaustive list)
    #define COLS      (getenv("COLS") ? atoi(getenv("COLS")) : 80)
    #define MAX(a, b) (a > b ? a : b)
    ```

 3. There is no way to reuse already generated bindings.  
    Bindgen outputs bindings also for headers that were included in a given header. See [#2].
 4. Type qualifiers `const`, `volatile` and `restrict` are not supported.
 5. Extern variables are read-only. See [scala-native/scala-native#202].
